pgconsole includes an AI assistant that helps you work with your database. Features include Text-to-SQL generation, query explanation, error fixing, query rewriting, and change risk assessment.

## Configuration

<Note> API keys are stored in your config file and never sent to the frontend. </Note>

Add one or more AI providers to your `pgconsole.toml`. See [AI Providers](/configuration/config#ai-providers) for the full field reference.

## Features

### Text-to-SQL

Generate SQL queries from natural language descriptions. Open the **Chat** tab in the right panel, select an AI provider, and describe the query you need. Conversations support multi-turn follow-ups.

### Fix SQL

When the editor detects a syntax error (via inline linting), an AI fix suggestion appears. Clicking it sends the SQL and error message to the AI, which returns a corrected version that replaces the original in the editor.

### Explain SQL

Get plain-language explanations of SQL queries.

**Usage:**

- Right-click a query in the editor and select **Explain with AI**
- Or click the **Explain** button in a function/procedure schema tab

The explanation opens in the Chat tab, where you can ask follow-up questions about the query.

### Rewrite SQL

**Usage:** Right-click a query in the editor and select **Rewrite with AI**.

The AI rewrites the query for better performance or readability, using your database schema for context. The rewritten SQL replaces the original in the editor.

### Change Risk Assessment

Analyze staged changes for potential risks before execution. In the [staged changes preview](/features/sql-editor#inline-editing), click **Assess Risk** to have the AI review the SQL. The assessment returns a list of findings, each with a severity level (high, moderate, low), category, and description.

## Schema Context

<Note> pgconsole only sends schema information to the AI provider. </Note>

The AI assistant uses your database schema to generate accurate queries. Schema context includes tables, columns, types, constraints, indexes, and comments.

Control which schemas are included in the AI context via the database icon in the Chat toolbar:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Current schema** (default) | Only the currently selected schema |
| **All schemas** | All non-system schemas |
| **Custom** | Cherry-pick specific schemas via checkboxes |
