<Info>pgconsole does not connect to any external license server, so it cannot auto-refresh the license. After purchasing a new subscription or renewing an existing one, a new license key will be emailed to you. Update the key in your configuration file and restart pgconsole for it to take effect.</Info>

## Purchasing a License

Purchase directly from the application via the **Subscription** option in the owner's profile menu, or use the links below:

- [Monthly plan — $20/user/month](https://buy.stripe.com/aFa00ifoZ8hHfEDgeN1Fe02)
- [Annual plan — $16/user/month](https://buy.stripe.com/28E28qfoZ69zcsr2nX1Fe03)

A license key will be emailed to you after purchase.

## Adding a License

Add your license key to the configuration file:

```toml pgconsole.toml
[general]
license = "your-license-key"
```

Restart pgconsole for the license to take effect.
